## 🧠 About This Repository

Welcome to my cybersecurity space! 🛡️  
This repository contains projects, scripts, research, and resources focused on **vulnerability assessment**, **penetration testing**, **threat hunting**, and **incident response**.

I aim to continuously improve security postures by identifying weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.
